# Angular 2 Interactive Map

This demo is something I put together to help figure out how to do an
interactive SVG map of the New Mexico counties for a project at work. I mocked
up a subset of the data, in this case the counties themselves, to
replicate what I'd done. Once I figured out the SVG map I created this repository to use as a reference point at work.

**Gettig Started**
1. npm install
2. npm start
